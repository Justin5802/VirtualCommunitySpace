# VirtualCommunitySpace

Project link: https://unitygridplaza.up.railway.app/

Overview
In this project, you'll create a virtual community space with an interactive interface that allows users to explore events by location. The user should be able to click on one of at least four locations and view events that have occurred or will occur there. Your virtual community can be real or imagined, but your site should help your target user find interesting stuff to do. Here are some examples:

Protests

Geocaching spots

Dromedary herders association meetups
